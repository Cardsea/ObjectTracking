# Silly Code License of Awesomeness (SCLA)

By using, modifying, or distributing this code, you agree to the following:

1. **This Code Is for Fun, Not Serious Business!**  
This code just wants to have a good time. It’s not here to change the world or solve your life problems. If it breaks, don’t blame it. It’s just trying its best. The goal is fun, laughter, and a little bit of weirdness. So, keep things light and enjoy the silliness!

2. **You Can Edit It, But Keep It Local**  
Feel free to use this code however you like, but **keep it to yourself**. Edit it, play with it, make it your own — but please don’t share, distribute, or upload it anywhere. It’s a secret treasure for you and your computer only. No spreading it around to the masses! If you want to show off your project, don’t upload this code; just share the results of your creative, silly work.

3. **Respect the Code, Be Nice**  
This code is just a humble little program trying its best. If it misbehaves, don’t throw it out the window. Instead, try giving it a gentle "Hey, it’s okay" and look through your code with a fresh set of eyes. Sometimes it just needs a little encouragement to get back on track.

4. **No Evil Stuff, Please**  
While you’re free to do whatever you want with the code, we ask that you keep it fun, harmless, and lighthearted. Please don’t use it to create anything that could cause harm or disrupt anyone else’s day (like turning all your friends into potatoes). Let’s keep the vibe positive and goofy.

5. **No Stealing or Distributing**  
This code is a little gift for you. You can edit it and improve it for your own use, but don’t take it and pass it around like it’s your own. If you need to tell someone about it, just tell them it’s a fun piece of code, but don’t distribute or share the actual files with anyone. Remember: what happens in your computer, stays in your computer.

6. **Enjoy It and Make Something Silly**  
The most important thing: Have fun with it! Make something that makes you laugh, smile, or just scratches that silly creative itch. Whether it’s a tiny dance program or an app that tells you knock-knock jokes, just keep it light and goofy. The world needs more silly projects.

7. **Don’t Make Anything Harmful**  
If you use this code for anything that’s harmful or causes any sort of damage, we will come find you (just kidding, we won’t). But seriously, be good with it. Don’t make anything dangerous or that could hurt others. Keep things fun and kind.

By using this code, you agree to follow these simple, silly rules. Now go and make something weird, fun, and totally awesome. Just keep it to yourself, and have a blast!
